# Credit-Risk-Alternative-Data
An analysis was conducted on eleven ML/DL models using both traditional and alternative credit data for the purpose of predicting loan defaults. The models used windowized features and SMOTE to optimize the acceptance rate at a 5% bad rate. TabNet and Wide&Deep were used to evaluate the feasibility of financial inclusion for borrowers without credit.
